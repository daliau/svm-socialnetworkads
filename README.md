# svm-socialnetworkads
a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is implemented and evaluated to address the classification problem of Social Network Ads. 
The aim is to determine whether a user would purchase a particular product based on a set of given features that describe the user. 
The features include user ID, gender, age, and estimated salary. 
We utilize the SVM algorithm that is known for its ability to handle both linear and nonlinear classification problems to classify whether a user would make a purchase of a
product or not.
